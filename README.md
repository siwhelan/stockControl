# stockControl

A Django web app designed to streamline a catering facility's operations with features for stock control, recipe creation and costing, gross profit guidance, and more.

With the aim of providing a complete food management system, this project leverages my experience in the hospitality industry to offer a user-friendly solution for monitoring food costs and kitchen management.

Please note that this project is a work in progress and is currently in it's initial stages. I will regularly update this repository and plan to document the process over on [dev.to](https://dev.to/siwhelan)

Feedback is welcome and appreciated! ðŸ‘‹
